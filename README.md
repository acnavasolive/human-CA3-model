# human-CA3-model

This is an anatomically guided full-scale model suited to study the human CA3 hippocampus. Based on Bennett et al (1994), this analytical approach allows modeling memory capacity and retrieval of memories in a non-distance dependent recurrent network. Our model suggests that the human brainâ€™s sparse connectivity, expanded neuronal number and reliable synaptic signaling combine to enhance the associative memory storage capacity of CA3.
